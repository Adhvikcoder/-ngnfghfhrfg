About me: Rye is a 1-year-old male rabbit looking for his forever family. He is a curious little guy who loves to explore and get his exercise by running obstacle courses! He is a little timid at first but becomes friendlier once he is comfortable with people. Rye prefers to have all his cage items in the center of his pen so he is able to use the perimeter as a running track! Chewing toys and proper rabbit safe proofing are a must for him as this curious guy will investigate all items to test his teeth on them! Please submit an adoption application to welcome this wonderful little guy into your home!

About me: Pumpernickel is a very playful 1-year-old male bunny and is looking to be in a home where he can get the attention he deserves! He really enjoys exploring out of his pen; he enjoys it so much that he manages to jump a 4-foot tall enclosure! Pumpernickel requires his forever home to have a spacious cage and preferably, a separate room that he can free roam in for exercise during the day. If you are looking for a fun and handsome rabbit to have at home, then Pumpernickel is the one for you!  About

About me: Pickles is a 1-year-old bunny and is looking for her owner to have rabbit experience. She is shy at first but her affection is easily won with veggies and a lot of patience. She especially loves cucumbers and baby carrots!

Once she is comfortable she is a wonderful rabbit. She enjoys getting little forehead rubs and hopping around her pen. She does not like to be picked up or held but will still be a lovely little work from home companion for you!

Jeeves was surrendered to us because his owners were unable to care for him.

Jeeves is an awesome bunny and likes people.

This handsome rabbit loves food (who doesn't!). The way to his heart is with treats. He is a pretty chill rabbit that is curious and friendly. He is a bit shy at first but will come around once he gets to know you. He is not keen on being picked up as he is a little bit of a larger bunny.

We don’t know a lot about Max but he’s friendly and active and he’s going to be neutered next week.

Are you the person who will show Max that he won’t be let down by humans again? Can you provide Max with lots of love and plenty of rabbit-proofed safe space indoors? He’s counting on you!

Talk about super handsome!

Toffee came to our shelter when his owner could no longer care for him. He’s a young and active rabbit who was neutered on May 18/21.

Let us tell you what a Rex rabbit’s fur is like: it feels like a plushy velour blanket! Rex rabbits also have short and stubby or curly whiskers.

All rabbits, and especially young, active guys like Toffee, need plenty of safe indoor rabbit-proofed space in which to do all rabbits’ favourite things: running, jumping, exploring, sprawling, doing binkies, etc.

You can apply online to adopt Toffee or any of our other adoptable rabbits at allistonhumane.com/adopt. Please include your preferred phone number so that we can reach you after you submit your application.

Little Lime and his sibling Lemon were surrendered to our shelter through no fault of their own. They are both young males and are estimated to have been born in November 2020. They are not a bonded pair and will be adopted separately.

Lime and his brother Lemon enjoy eating their hay and pellets, and although they don’t mind being petted, Lemon enjoys it a little more.

Even small rabbits do best when they are given lots of exercise time in a large bunny-proofed area where they can enjoy just being curious and active bunnies.

Even though he was surrendered, Lime, like Lemon, still knows that there’s a true forever home for him out there!

You can apply online to adopt Lime at allistonhumane.com/adopt and our Small Animals Adoption Coordinator will contact you after your application submission.

Liza came to us from another rescue where her time was running out. Sadly, during her 2 year life she was never allowed out of her enclosure area and this has made her wary of those coming into her space.

Liza needs a gentle, calm and patient bunny lover to help her learn to trust humans again. Ample space to run and explore is good for every bunny and certainly for Liza!

Please complete your online adoption application form at allistonhumane.com/adopt and our Small Animals Adoptions Coordinator will call you to talk with you about Miss Liza.

Liza is looking for love and patience and understanding!
Think you and Liza might be a match?

            <span>   <p>Meet Cosmo and Wanda
** PLEASE VISIT LADYBIRDANIMALSANCTUARY.COM TO APPLY TO ADOPT OR WITH ANY INQUIRIES **

Wanda and Cosmo were found together as strays and brought to Hamilton Animal Services. It is assumed they are siblings. Because they were male and female, HAS staff separated them, but put their cages next to each other so they could still be close. No owner came forward to claim Wanda and Cosmo, and when a foster home opened up, we were thrilled to get them out of the shelter.
We had Wanda and Cosmo fixed on their rescue day, and they were very happy to be reunited once they were healed from their surgeries.
A short time after their rescue, Wanda and Cosmo’s foster mom noted that Wanda was a little wobbly. She gets around just fine (and she zooms and binkies like a champ!) but the unsteadiness is noticeable when she does things like lean over to clean her sides. She’ll lose her balance or tip over a bit. She’s otherwise happy and healthy and it doesn’t slow her down at all.
Our vets put Wanda on medication in case the condition was possible parasitic infection that affects rabbits. Even though Wanda was the only one showing symptoms, we treated both rabbits since they were found together. After a month of the medication, Wanda’s wobble is still the same. She had a follow up vet appointment, and though we don’t have a concrete diagnosis, it’s likely Wanda’s condition is congenital, as it has not progressed or changed since she came into our care. Wanda and Cosmo are very bonded to each other, so we are asking they be adopted as a pair.

Back in November, Cosmo and Wanda were adopted but unfortunately their adopters suffered serious injuries in a vehicle accident. Though Cosmo and Wanda’s adopters don’t want to let these lovely bunnies go, they’re no longer able to physically care for them. Thankfully their adopters are willing to keep Cosmo and Wanda until they find their new home.

Here’s a note from their family:
“Cosmo and Wanda are simply spectacular, and the two together create an adorable dynamic that’s simply unbreakable. At first it can be hard to distinguish which is which, but over time it becomes obvious enough to tell the difference instantly.

Wanda is a very playful bunny, curious to the bone. She wants to know what you have, she wants to know what you’re doing, and she wants to know why you aren’t currently giving her pets. Cosmo can be more reserved and standoffish, but he well makes up for it by being the sweetest, kindest little boy. Approaching either of them will result likely in you having no choice but to provide pets or goodies, and if you dare choose just one to entertain you’ll be sure the other will be soon to nudge his/her way in. Petting usually ends with two bunnies mooshed into the ground, eyes closed, loving life.

Feeding time is always hilarious, the mere crinkle of a bag will send the bunnies into a frenzy of running around your feet in anticipation. Giving treats is a very pleasant experience, they’re eager and needy as all bunnies tend to be, but when it comes to eating from your hand you can be certain they’ll never bite or nibble on you. They are also nearly flawlessly litter trained, you will never find pee outside of the box, but the odd poop is unavoidable (they get too excited).

Don’t be fooled, these two can be a lot of work, but the reward is worth it. It is my hope that these two wonderful creatures find a loving home that can give them tons of space for binkies, and with luck a backyard enclosure from which they can enjoy the fresh grass of a nice summer afternoon. They really deserve it.

Whoever is right for these two lagomorphs is going to be very lucky..”

Please adopt Cosmo and Wanda!

Adoption fee is $250 for the pair.

Birdie will be ready to go to her forever home after she is spayed.

Birdie and her sisters love to greet their foster parent with zoomies and binkies, They are full of energy and love using their fosters back as a diving board to continue zooming around. They also enjoy hiding under blankets and peeking out at you. After playing they love to stretch out and take a nap together. They enjoy head and cheek pats until they drift off to sleep,.

They are friendly toward children and do not chew baseboards. Their litter habits are getting better every day and they rarely have any accidents.

Birdie would be a great candidate to bond with a boy bunny, or two sisters can go home together now under a foster-to-adopt arrangement.
